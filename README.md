# LogoVideoPlayer

LogoVideoPlayer is a very simple app based on ARKit that shows how image tracking works in ARKit 2 and how it can be used for achieving cool results with a few lines of code.

The app will detect a logo and play a video on top of it.

## Requirements

For building and running this app you will need:

* Xcode 10+.
* iOS 12+.
* A physical device - as ARKit is not supported by simulators - supporting ARKit, see the compatible devices here: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeviceInformation/Reference/iOSDeviceCompatibility/DeviceCompatibilityMatrix/DeviceCompatibilityMatrix.html.

## Supported logos

This app has been created for demo purpose as part of a talk at https://vallahackathon.es/, organized by https://gregoriofer.com. 

Later it was updated for the same talk in https://www.ubu.es/.

Therefore, both Gregorio Fernandez and UBU logos are supported and if you want to see the app working "as it is" you will need to print any of those logos :-).

You can easily add your own assets for detecting any other image and playing a different video.
